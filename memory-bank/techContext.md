# Tech Context

The primary technology focus is on Large Language Models (LLMs) and related techniques such as LLM Agents and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The examples provided are generally in Python, utilizing common libraries and conceptual patterns found in the LLM ecosystem (e.g., mock LLM/embedding models, vector databases). No specific framework (like LangChain or LlamaIndex) is strictly enforced for the examples, aiming for conceptual clarity, though these frameworks are mentioned as practical tools.
