# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Initializing the memory bank as per user request.

**Recent Changes:**
- Created `LLM_Agent_Tutorial.md` with comprehensive content on LLM Agents and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` and `memory-bank/productContext.md`.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue creating the remaining core memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Once all core memory bank files are created, confirm the initialization with the user.

**Important patterns and preferences:**
- Tutorials should be comprehensive, easy to understand, and include practical examples (pseudocode).
- Focus on core concepts and their practical implications.

**Learnings and project insights:**
- The user is interested in foundational and advanced LLM topics.
