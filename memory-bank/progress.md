# Progress

**What works:**
- Initial `LLM_Agent_Tutorial.md` covering LLM Agents and RAG has been created and updated.
- `memory-bank` directory has been created.
- Core memory bank files `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` have been initialized.

**What's left to build:**
- Ensure all core memory bank files are complete and accurately reflect the project context.
- Continue to add more tutorials or expand existing ones as per user requests.

**Current status:**
- Memory bank initialization is in progress.

**Known issues:**
- None at this moment.

**Evolution of project decisions:**
- The decision to create detailed tutorials on LLM Agents and RAG directly responds to the user's explicit requests, emphasizing the focus on practical, educational content.
